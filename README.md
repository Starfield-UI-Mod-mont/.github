## 🧩 What Is a Starfield UI Mod?

A **UI mod** (User Interface mod) changes the look, layout, or functionality of Starfield’s menus and on-screen elements. These mods don’t mess with the core game – they just make the interface way more usable and stylish.

You can make the HUD disappear when you’re exploring, upgrade your inventory with filters, or even replace the compass with something way more sci-fi 🚀
